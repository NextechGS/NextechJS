# Code of Conduct

One of NextechJS's strengths is our community. Our contributors and users are pushing the 3D geospatial field to amazing new levels. We rely on an open, friendly, inclusive environment to facilitate this. As such, we follow the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/)'s [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md) to ensure a harassment-free experience in the NextechJS community. Any unacceptable behavior can be confidentially sent to the core team.

This applies to the main NextechJS repo, forum, twitter, and all channels, including all repos in the [NextechGS](https://github.com/NextechGS) GitHub organization.
